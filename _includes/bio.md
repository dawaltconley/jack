I am both a story-teller, and an artist. The past few years, I have been working as a video editor and videographer. I work in a wide range of genres, and this website organizes my work to make it easier for you, the viewer, to see. I have a passion for story telling, and I have a section of my narrative videos. I am also a video artist and have a section for my experimental videos. I have made a lot of short documentaries, and different freelance contract work, and you can find all of those on this website as well. Please pour through my work and let me know what you think. If there is any video project I can assist you with, please email me and I will reply ASAP. Enjoy my loyal viewers!
